# iic-circdia

This is a fork of Stefan Krause's `circdia` LaTeX package (http://www.taylorgruppe.de/circdia/) with modifications for the Institute for Integrated Circuits, Johannes Kepler University.

The regular updates from Stefan's Zip-file are tracked.

For exemplary use of this LaTeX package, see `demo_circdia.tex`. This package has also been used to create the circuit figures in this publication: https://doi.org/10.1109/MSSC.2021.3088968

Changes versus the original package:
* Added MOSFET symbols according to Razavi book style (elements `nmos`, `nmos*`, `pmos`, `pmos*`)
* Added new VDD/VSS symbols according to Razavi book style (elements `iicvdd` and `iicvss`)
* Tweaked appearance of resistor and capacitor symbols to make a bit more pleasing
